# Case-study-super-store-data-analysis


*Introduction:*

This repository contains the findings and recommendations resulting from an extensive data analysis conducted on the sales and profitability data of a prominent superstore. The investigation was triggered by the discovery of a significant financial loss despite impressive sales figures, indicating an underlying mystery that needed to be unraveled. As a data analyst, we delved deep into years of data, applying advanced data cleansing techniques and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover the hidden story behind the store's struggles.

*Data Cleaning:*

Before proceeding with the analysis, we performed rigorous data cleansing to ensure data accuracy and reliability. The following steps were taken:

1. Examining Summary Statistics: We checked for anomalies and contradictions in the summary statistics to identify potential issues in the data.

2. Removing Duplicate Records: Duplicate records were removed to avoid skewing the analysis and to maintain data integrity.

3. Adding More Columns: Additional columns were added to the dataset to capture more data and insights, enhancing the analysis.

4. Advanced Data Imputation and Outlier Detection: We used advanced data imputation techniques to fill in missing values and identified and treated outliers that could affect the analysis.

5. Data Normalization: Data normalization was performed to bring all numerical data to a common scale, facilitating meaningful comparisons.

*EDA Analysis Insights:*

After conducting data cleansing, we proceeded with the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain valuable insights into the superstore's sales and profitability. The following key insights were uncovered:

1. Count of Subcategories: The distribution of products across subcategories was analyzed, providing a clear understanding of the store's product offerings.

2. Most Preferred Ship Mode: The preferred shipping mode was identified, which can assist in optimizing logistics and customer satisfaction.

3. Customer Segments: The analysis categorized customers into segments, with the majority falling into the Consumer and Corporate groups.

4. Sales by City, State, and Region: The sales distribution across various geographical regions was studied, helping to identify areas of strength and weakness.

5. Category and Subcategory Analysis: The performance of different product categories and subcategories was examined, revealing high-performing and low-performing items.

*Conclusions, Recommendations, and Findings:*

Based on the insights gained from the data analysis, we draw the following conclusions and make relevant recommendations to address the superstore's financial difficulties:

1. High-Performing Products: The Technology subcategory, especially products like Phones and Chairs, stands out as the most selling and most profitable items. It is advised to leverage these products to offset losses from lower-profitable items.

2. Package Deals: Introduce package deals comprising a range of office necessities for customers looking to set up a home office. This will appeal to busy customers who prefer convenience and could boost sales.

3. Addressing Losses: Consider removing less profitable products like Supplies, Bookcases, and Tables from the catalogue or negotiate with suppliers for better prices to mitigate losses.

4. Targeted Promotions: Focus on promoting and offering special deals to customers in the East and West areas, in addition to the top 10 cities with the highest sales, to drive more consumer and home office sales.

5. Home Office Segment Development: Invest in advertising and promotions in cities with lower sales in the home office segment to increase awareness and boost sales. Utilize product package promotions based on frequently purchased items.
